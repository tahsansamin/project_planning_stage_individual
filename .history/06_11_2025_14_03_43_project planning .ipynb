    "In order to answer this question the players.csv file will be used. First, the name and hashed email's of all the players will be removed to keep the data confidential. Also , the player experience variable will be changed to be a factor data format. Next, the rows that have NA or missing values for player age , number of hours played and newsletter subscription status will be removed because there are not many NA or missing values so removing them is very unlikely to cause loss of valuable data ( btw check this Samin!). After that, the hours played and age variables will be standardized so no one variable takes more weight in prediction that the other. Finally, the K nearest-neighbors algorithm will be applied to predict a player's newsletter susbcription status based on their age and the number of hours they have played."
